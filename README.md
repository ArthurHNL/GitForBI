# GitForBI

A tool that can run git commands (and other commands) that can be placed on the laptop of a business engineer.

## What does this tool?

This tool invokes git to checkout the latest version of a branch. It can also run commands before and after invoking git.

## Why did I create this tool?

We had to do a school project with 7 software students, and two IT-Business students. The IT-Business students however, can't be expected to know how git works so I created this tool that lets them use git and the application we develop without having to learn how git works and how to install dependencies.

## How do I configure this tool?

Take a look at the config.json file.
